# 💼 Dario Bootstrap Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website created as part of my training at **Code Institute**.

The project was originally designed as a **template for a fictional user**, but I decided to **personalize it** and make it represent **myself** as a web developer in training.

It uses **Bootstrap 5** to build a modern, responsive layout that works well on all devices.

## 📌 Project Overview

The website includes:
- A responsive navigation bar
- A hero section with a personal introduction
- An “About” section with information about me
- A “Portfolio” section that showcases real and practice projects
- A contact form
- A modal popup for newsletter sign-up

The layout adapts to all screen sizes thanks to **Bootstrap’s grid system** and utility classes.
